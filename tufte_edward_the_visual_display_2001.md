# The Visual Display of Wuantitative Information
## Edward R. Tufte

**Second Edition, 2001**

### Intro

Book begain in 1975 when Princeton asked Tufte to teach statistics to a dozen journalists visiting to learn economoics. Annotated a collection of readings, with a long section on statistical graphics. Scant literature at the time and most ly concerning "graphic standards" not best practices of qantiatiative reasoning and visual evidence. 

>Data graphics visually display measured quantities by means of the combined use of points, lines, a coordinate system, numbers, symbols, words, shading, and color.

Use of abstract, non-representational pictures to show nubers is a surprisingly recent invention. Not intil 1750-1800 that statistical graphics - length and area for quantity, time series, scatterplots, and multivariate displays - were invented. (After logarithms, cartesian coordinates, calculus, and basics of probability theory)

**William Playfair (1759-1823)** developed or improved nearly all the fundaental graphical designs of his "linear arithmetic."

At their best, graphics are instruments for reasoning about quantitative information. Of all the methods for analyzing and communicating statistical information, well-designed data fraphics are usually the simplest and most powerful.

First part of book - examples. Second part - language for discussing graphics and practical theory of data graphics. 

Concerned with how to communication through the simultaneous presentation of words, numbers, and pictures. 

Annually 900 Billion - 2 Trillion images of statistical graphics are printed. 

# I. Graphical Practice

## 1. Graphical Excellence

Ability to present complesx ideas with clarity, precision, and efficiency:
- Show the data
- Induce the viewer to think about the substance, **NOT**
    - Methodology
    - Graphic Design

**Anscombe's quartet** All have same linear model, but quite different.
