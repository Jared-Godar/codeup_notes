## Chapter 2: Shell Shocked

- Tiny market fluctiations. *market inefficiencies* that become predictable from analysus can bring in millions to the first investor who discovers them. Keep churning profits until phenomenon ends or the resot of the market realized it.

Shaw investments. Fast-paced. Everything powered by math. Most quants abstract math or physics background. 

People's retirement fnds and mortgages. All their gains came from someone elses' loss. 

### Housing crisis

July 2007 "interbank" interest spliked. After recession following 2001 attacks, low interest loans fueled a housing boom. Anyone could get a mortgage - building vast new developments, banks gambled billions on the financial instriments tied to the building boom.

Fising interest rates signaled touble. Banks were losing trust in each other to pay back overnight loans. Coming to grips with dagerous hunk in their own portfolios and judged others were likely sitting on as much risk or more.

Hedge funds don't ride markets up, but predict the movements within them - down could be every bit as lucrative.

robert Rubin's gutting of Glass- Steagall Act allowed banks to originate (fraudulent) loans and sell them to their customers as securities while betting against the very securities they sold their customers.

What if tomorrow didn't resemble yesterday/ All the models based on the past and the assumption that patterns would repeat. 

Bundled mortgages, as a kind of bond, to play regular dividends. Became pilar of capitol market. Divided into tranches, some considered rock-solid others carried more risk - and a higher interest rate.

Banks were making money loaning people money for homes they couldn't afford. Write unsustrainible mortgages, collect the feesm then unload the loan onto the mortgage security markey. Strawberry-picker in Rancho Grande making $14,000 a year financed $720,000 house.

"Emerging markets" "ghetto loans" actively sought out poor and minority victums for predatory loans.

Risk model attached to mortgage-backdd securities - WMD. False assumptions: mathemeticians were crunching the numbers and balancing risk, assumed tht not many peoplke would default at the same time - defaults theorized to be largely random and unrelated events. Led to belief that solid morggages would offset the losers in each tranche. Risk models assumed future would look like th epast.

Banks needed AAA ratings to sell the bonds. THree credit rating agencies. Rating became big business generating big fees. If they rated anything less than AAA, the banks would take their business to their competitors - paid more interest to customer satisfction than to accuracy of models. Pernicious feedback loops. 

AAA ratings on defective products turned into dollars, which created confidence in products rated -- mutual back-scratching and pocket-filling. 

Issue of scale. Modern computing fueled fraud at scale unparalleled in history. Compounded bvy other bast markets that grew up areound MBS - CDO's Collaterized Debt Obligations and credit default swaps. Swaps were small insurance policies that transferred the risk on a bond. Banks and hedges a sense of security - supposedly balanced risk. But if the entities holding the insurance policies go belly up, as many did, the chain reaction blows holes through the global economy

Synthetic CDOs went one step further: contracts whose walue depended on the performance of credit default swaps and mortgage-backed securities.

$3T sypprime by 2007. Market around it magnified risk 20-fold. Larger than any national economy.

Only people could sift through the mortgages to figure out what was horseshit and what wasn't. Painstaking because people, unlinke originating algorithms, cna;t scale theit work exponentially -- and that work, at this time, was low prioroty.

Value of the debt and homes kept falling. Owners who could afford mortgages before economic nosedive were now at risk of defaulting too. 

Secondhalf of 2008, disaster hit mainstream - started seeing the people on the other side of the algorithms. Millions of americans losing jons. Credit card defaults, 

Monte Carlo search.

### Arms Race: Going to College

One WMD issue is scale. A formula - be it a diet or tax code - may be perfectly innovuous in theory. But if it grows to be a national or global standard, it creates its own distorted and dystopian economy. This happened in higher education.

1983 *U.S. News & World Report* decided to evaluate and rank 1,800 colleges and universities. 

In the beginning, scores based entirely on opinion surveys. Hit with readers, but administrators questioned fiarness - look at the *data*.

Start out with series of hunches - not a scientific process and scant grounding in statistical analysis. Just people wondering what matters most, figuring out which variables they can count, and deciding how much weight to give each in a formula.

Most disciplines this type of analysis would demand more rigor - some kind of scoring system rating the model to reality, but "educational excellence" was harder to define, quantify, and nothing to really compare to model. Can't directly measure learning, hapiness, confidence, friendship, or other important aspects.

Picked proxies that seemed to corrolate with success. SAT scores, student-teacher ratios, and acceptance rates. Percentage of freshman to sophomore to graduates. Percentage of living alumni who donated. 3/4 of the rating was from an algorithmy formalizing these opinions in code, remaining quarter factored subjective views from surveys.

1988 was first data-driven ranking. Results seemed sensible. But it became the national stndard and started a vicious feedback loop. Ranking self-reinforcing. If a college fared badly in the eating, its reputation would suffer, and conditions would deterioate. Top students and teachers would avoid it and rankings would tumble further.

Room for varying opinions with good arguments on each side previously with college reputations. Now overshadowed by single column of numbers. College presidents scrambled to boost performance in 15 areas defined by journalists at a secont-tier magazine.

Report quickly became a national standard. Great scale, widespread damage, and spiral of destructive feedback loops. Not as opaque as many other models, but still a WMD.

Baylor pays for students to retake the SAT, schools sent false SAT data to US News, and other factors fudged.

When you create a model from proxies, it is simpler to game the system. Proxies are easier to manipulate than the complicated reality they represent.

Forcing everyone to shoor for the same goals creates a rat race with harmful unintended consequences. 

Financing - tuition and fees - left out of the model. What is the objective of the modeler? Wanted model to show historically top schools on top. If finances were considered, cheaper good schools could have placed highly which could create surprises and dow doubts. Safer to start with venerable champions on top. Presidents had 15 factors to consider, but keepingcosts low wasn't one of them. Raised prices to address others.

1985-2013, cost of higher education rose by over 500%, nearly four times the rate of inflatio. Building booms and increased amenities to attract top students. 

Students trrated like investment portfolios with assets and liabilities. Educational consulting firms rank prospects by geography, gender, ethnicity, field of study, academic standard, etc. All within ecosystem of US News rankings. As rankings grow, so do efforts to game them. Global - Saudi Arabia King Abdulaziz University math department jumed to 7th place in 2 years beeating Cambridge and MIT. School offered highlycited mathemeticians $72k to serve as adjunct faculty. Flew business class and five star hotel couple weeks a year. Change affiliation on THomson Reuters citation website - claiming citations of adjunct faculty and significantly boosting ratings.

Coaches and tutors and test-prep industry. Top-Tier admissions four day "application boot camp" costs $16,000 plus room and board. Develop essays, interview coaching, and other prep. With future success hinging on elite university - people pay the price.

Victims are the vast majority of Americans - poor and middle class who don;t have thousands of dollars to spend on courses and consultants. Miss out on key insider knowledge. Result is an education system that favors the privliged. Tilts against needy stdents and deepens the social divide.

Obama proposed new college ranking model, more in tune with national priorities and middle-class means. Sap power from for-profit education institutions. Use different metrics: affordability, percentage of poor and minority suudents, and postgraduate job placement, graduation rate. If college failed to meet standards, cut off from $180B/year federal student loan market (which for-profit universities have been feasting on).

Seem like worthy goals, but every ranking system ca be gamed. Different feedback loops with unintinded consequences.

Easy to raise graduation rates by lowering standards. Income of graduates can be boosted by eliminating training programs in lower paid jobs - teachers, social workers, etc.

Lower costs by reducing percentage of tenured faculty replacing expensive proessors with cheaper instructors or adjuncts.

Graduates employed after nine months gamed - some schools hired own graduates for hourly temp jobs to count as employed.

## Chapter 4. Propaganda Machine: Online Advertising

People leave rvers of data giving advertisers the ability to learn about them in grat detail. Which, in turn enables companies to target them with valuable information at just the right time and place.

Justification? Argues personalized advertising would be useful and timely that customers would welcome it. Thoughts were that people objected to ads because they were irrelavent. 

For-profit colleges, University of Phoneix targeted poor people with the bait of upward mobility. Multimillion-dollar operations underwritten by government-financed loans and the diplomas offered had scant value in the workplace. 

## Chapter 5 Civilian Casualties: Justice in the Age of Big Data

Lots of predictive crime algorithms that shape patrol and enforcement patterns. Can increase efficiency of budget-strapped police forces. Generates "hot-spots" based on past trends, increased presence in these areas lowers some crime rates. Siminar to baseball defense-shifting models. Increased presence results in increased enforcement of lower-teir nonviolent, nuisance crimes. More reports - more crime - more cops in same areas - more reports - feedback cycle filling prisons with hundreds of thousands of people found guilty of victimless crimes. Many poorer neighborhoods - predominately blacks and hispanics. So, even if models are race-bline, the results are not.

Petty crimes have been linked to more serious ones since 1982 - George Kelling article on "broken windows polcing: concept where lower level crimes create an atmosphere of disorder, scaring away law-abiding citizens, and becoming breeding grounds for serious crimes. 90's zero-tolerance campaigns, famously in NYC. Gained broad support - millions of young minority men sent to prion, many for minor offenses.

Most jurisdictions a crime map of petty crime tracks powerty - reinforcing society's conceptions that poor are responsible for shortcomings and commit most of the crime. 

Financial crimes - low priority. Wealth and lobbies lead to underpolicing. If zero-tolerance enforves. Choices made on where to focus attention. Criminalized poverty nelieving tools used are scientific and fair.

Data "hackathon" bringing together hackers, nerds, mathematicians, and software geeks to look at stop and frisk. Bloomerg raised 600% - 700,000 spot checks. Majority of those stopped were innocent. 85% of stops were of yound aftican american or latino men. Many stopped repeatedly. 0.1% linked to violent ctime. Drug posession, underaged drinking prosecuted. Determined to be unconstitutional. 

WMDs often faced with choice between fairness and efficacy. Legal traditions lean towards fairness. Constitution presumes innocence and engineered to value it. WMDs favor efficiency. Fairness is hard to quantify. Are we willing to sacrifice a bit of efficiency for fairness? Handicap models leaving certain data out? Justice should be something one part of society inflicts upon the other. 

Recidivism study in Harris country. 2.6M recods. Longer inmate spent locked up, greater chance they would be unemployed upon release, require food stamps and public assistance, commit further crimes.

Facial recognition emerging for broader surveilance. Shifting to identifying potential lawvreakers problematic.

Independent of legaliity, these tests are poor predictors of jon performance. Illegal screens for mental illness. Process is opaque.
