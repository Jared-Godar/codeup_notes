### Intro

Book begain in 1975 when Princeton asked Tufte to teach statistics to a dozen journalists visiting to learn economoics. Annotated a collection of readings, with a long section on statistical graphics. Scant literature at the time and most ly concerning "graphic standards" not best practices of qantiatiative reasoning and visual evidence. 

>Data graphics visually display measured quantities by means of the combined use of points, lines, a coordinate system, numbers, symbols, words, shading, and color.

Use of abstract, non-representational pictures to show nubers is a surprisingly recent invention. Not intil 1750
