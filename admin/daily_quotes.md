Maggie - Steal Like an Artist Austin Klyon

Ten things nobody told you about being creative:
"Art that only comes from the head isn't any good."

Coding / data science *is* a creative enterprise. Ideas and inspiration often come while working on other things. Maintaining balance makes us better, not a problem from not coding all the time. Balance is essential.

From Ryan. If the blinking cursor is making you want to write code, slow down - plan it out - paper / whiteboard

Maggie: throwing program, function, or machine learning algorithm at every problem - you're on the track to having a job that will be automated. Using human intelligence and thinking can't be automated. That's your job security.

Often assumed that numbers are cold, hard, objective truth. In data science and with statistical tools can see what we are looking for - either benignly or maliciously - must maintain perspective and strive to avoid bias in analysis.

Learn on something you are willing to destroy. Mistakes are inevitable - learn on something where the stakes are low. Learn to sew on scraps.

Document what you are doing so your future self can see what you are doing. Give variables meaningful names. Optimize for reading code, not writing code.
