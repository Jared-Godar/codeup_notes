Maggie - Steal Like an Artist Austin Klyon

Ten things nobody told you about being creative:
"Art that only comes from the head isn't any good."

Coding / data science *is* a creative enterprise. Ideas and inspiration often come while working on other things. Maintaining balance makes us better, not a problem from not soding all the time. Balance is essential.

Maggie: throwing program, fuction, or machine learning algorithm at every problem - you're on the track to having a job that will be automated. Using human intellegence and thinking can't be automated. That's your job security.

> “ ‘When someone seeks,’ said Siddhartha, ‘then it easily happens that his eyes see only the thing that he seeks, and he is able to find nothing, to take in nothing. [...] Seeking means: having a goal. But finding means: being free, being open, having no goal.’” -Hermann Hesse

Often assumed that numbers are cold, hard, objective truth. In data science and with statistical tools can see what we are looking for - either benignly or maliciously - must maintain perspective and strive to avoid bias in analysis.

>"Practicing sewing/designing clothes? If all you have is expensive cloth, you'll never want to cut and learn to sew. No one learns to drive in a Ferrari on a mountain road." - Kathleen Dollard (Microsoft)

Learn on something you are willing to destroy. Mistakes are inevitable - learn on something where the stakes are low. Learn to sew on scraps.
