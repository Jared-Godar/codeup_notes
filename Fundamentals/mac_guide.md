# Mac OS notes

## Differences

### Drag and Drop**

- Drag file to a new location on the same disk
    - Default to move files to that location
    - Sometimes weird permission issues only allow you to copy from one area to another
    - `option + drag` will copy instead of move

### Aliases

- UNIX links
- Aliases (Mac-specific)
    - Directory entries that redirect you to a file of another location
    - Allows you to access the same file in its original path from multiple places without duplicating it.
- `Command+Option+Drag` See curved arrow. Released to alias.
    - Can be used to creat a folder of commonly used applications to put into the dock as a stack

## Folder Navigation

- Reveal both source file as well as desired destination in orger to copy or move
- Can navigate through the file system by hovering your dragged selection over a folder until it highlights
    - Brief delay and folder opens
    - Press space bar to open folder immdiately

### Undo / Prevent changes

- When dragging and dropping, `Command-Z` should revert changes
- If you inadvertantly grabed too many or the wrong things,  pressing the `escape`key will cancel thr drag event and the selected files will return to their original locations.
